The study of surfaces in a strictly topological viewpoint has led us to forget significant information about them. A way to revert this is to attach a group to it, the \textbf{mapping class group} of the surface. It is denoted by $Mod(S)$ and encodes the \textit{symmetries} of the surface. This group is defined as the set of isotopy classes of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $S$. In the first section of this chapter, we give the formal definition of this group and establish the very important role of this concept in Mathematics. 

The \textbf{curve complex} of the surface, denoted by $C(S)$ appears naturally in the study of $Mod(S)$. It is a simplicial complex that encodes intersection patterns of simple closed curves in $S$. We focus part of the discussion on the relationship between the algebraic structure of $Mod(S)$ and the combinatorial topology of $S$.

Many of the progress in understanding $Mod(S)$ has been possible by a well-known analogy among two very important classes of groups: arithmetic groups and mapping class groups. In this parallelism panorama, the desire of an equivalent result to the Margulis Superrigidity for mapping class groups arises.

In the last section of this chapter, we settle the bases to understand rigidity within a Graph theory context. An approach called \textit{rigid expansions}, see \cite[Aramayona, Leininger 16]{finiteRigidSetsJA} and \cite[Hernandez 19]{exhaustionCurveGraph}, allows us to build up subgraphs preserving the rigidity property and is compatible with stochastic tools.
 
Many results and definitions in this chapter were extracted from \cite[Farb]{Farb}. They are quite popular and equivalents can easily be found in the literature, however, they are written here to establish nomenclature. Familiarity with basic concepts is assumed.

\section{Mapping class group of a surface}

We have the following fundamental, well-known result about surfaces.

\begin{theorem}[Classification of surfaces]\label{CST}
Any closed, connected, orientable surface is homeomorphic to the connected sum of a 2-dimensional sphere with $g \geq 0$ tori. Any compact, connected, orientable surface is obtained from a closed surface by removing $b \geq 0 $ open disks with disjoint closures. Even more, the set of homeomorphism types of compact surfaces is in bijective correspondence with the set $\{ (g, b) : g, b \geq 0\}$.
\end{theorem}

We are so familiar with this result that we usually forget what it is saying. It seems like, in the eyes of a topologist, surfaces are just boring, but this is because we are forgetting all the geometric information about them. $Mod(S)$ helps to recover this data, the magic happens when this group acts on the \textbf{Teichmüller space} of $S$, which is the space of hyperbolic metrics on $S$ up to isotopy. A central result is that this action is properly discontinuous and the quotient space $M(S) = Teich(S)/ Mod(S)$ is the \textbf{moduli space of Riemannian surfaces homeomorphic to $S$}. The space $M(S)$ is an essential object in mathematics and the group $Mod(S)$ encodes most of the topological features of $M(S)$.

$Mod(S)$, $Teich(S)$, and $M(S)$ can be found in several of different contexts in mathematics: hyperbolic geometry, algebraic geometry, combinatorial group theory, geometric group theory, symplectic geometry, 3-manifold theory, dynamics, and so on. The algebraic structure of $Mod(S)$, the geometry of $Teich(S)$, and the topology of $M(S)$ are just the strands that are used to weave the rich tapestry of the nature of the surface.

Before we continue, let us establish some nomenclature. The $g$ in \ref{CST} is called the \textit{genus} of the surface and the $b$ is the number of \textit{boundary components}. One way to obtain a non-compact surface from a compact one is to remove $m$ points from the interior of it; in this case, we say that the resulting surface has $m$ punctures. From now on, unless otherwise specified, we will be thinking of compact, connected, oriented surfaces that are possibly punctured (in this case they cease to be compact). Therefore, we can specify the surfaces by the triplet $(g, b, m)$. We will denote by $S_{g,m}$ a surface of genus $g$ with $m$ punctures and empty boundary; such a surface is homeomorphic to the interior of a compact surface with $m$ boundary components. Also, for a closed surface of genus $g$, we will abbreviate $S_{g,0}$ as $S_{g}$ and $\partial S$ denotes the (possibly disconnected) boundary of $S$.

There are numerous definitions for the mapping class group of a surface. We will be working with the following:

\begin{defini}
Let $S$ be a surface, the \textbf{mapping class group} of $S$, denoted by $Mod(S)$, is the following quotient:
$$Mod(S)=Homeo^{+}(S)/Homeo_{0}(S),$$ 
where $Homeo^{+}(S)$ is the group of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $S$, that are the identity on the boundary. $Homeo_{0}(S)$ is the subgroup formed by homeomorphisms of $S$ that are isotopic to the identity.
\end{defini}

We could consider diffeomorphisms instead of homeomorphisms, or homotopy classes instead of isotopy classes; this results in isomorphic groups, see \cite[Farb, p.~41]{Farb} for details in why we can do this. Summarizing, we can find the following variations in the definition of $Mod(S)$:

\centerline{\begin{tabular}{ rcl }
$Mod(S)$ & $=$ & $\pi_{0}(Homeo^{+}(S, \partial S))$\\
 & $\approx$ & $Homeo^{+}(S,\partial S)/\textit{homotopy}$\\
 & $\approx$ & $\pi_{0} (\textit{Diff}^{+}(S,\partial S)),$\\
\end{tabular}}

\noindent where $\textit{Diff}^{+}(S, \partial S)$ is the group of orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of $S$ that are the identity on the boundary. It can be taken to be either smooth homotopy relative to the boundary or smooth isotopy relative to the boundary.

Thanks to Thurston's classification theorem there is a characterization of the homeomorphisms of a compact orientable surface. This classification is useful to describe the curve graph which will be analyzed in the next section.

\subsection{Nielsen–Thurston classification}
Given a homeomorphism $f: S \to  S$, there is a map $g$ isotopic to $f$ such that at least one of the following statements holds:

\begin{itemize}
\item $g$ is periodic, i.e. some power of $g$ is the identity;
\item $g$ preserves some finite union of disjoint simple closed curves on $S$ (in this case, g is called reducible); or
\item $g$ is pseudo-Anosov.
\end{itemize}

The definition of a \textbf{pseudo-Anosov map} relies on the notion of a measured foliation, a geometric structure on $S$. It consists of a singular foliation and a measure in the transverse direction (i.e. that is constant in transverse arcs). For the full definition of pseudo-Anosov elements and the proof of this theorem, we can refer to \cite[Farb, ch.~13]{Farb}.

The study of mapping class groups is a wide and challenging area. It is outside of the interests of this thesis to review the details and repercussions of this vast field. Yet, there are several known properties of $Mod(S)$ that it would be nice to have in mind for further work:

\begin{itemize}
\item Finitely generated and presented.
\item It has a subgroup of finite index which doesn't have torsion.
\item $Mod(S_{g,m}) \cong Out(\pi_{1}(S_{g,m}))$, for the closed case.
\item $H_{1}(Mod(S_{g,m}), \Z) = 1$ when $(g\geq3, m=0)$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Curve graph}

\subsection{Simple closed curves}

\begin{defini}
A \textbf{closed curve} in a surface $S$ is a continuous map $\S^{1}\to S$ and it's called \textbf{simple} if the map is an embedding. We will usually identify a closed curve with its image in $S$. A closed curve is called \textbf{essential} if it is not homotopic to a point, a puncture, or a boundary component.
\end{defini}
Among the adjectives that a curve can acquire we have the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\alpha$ is \textbf{separating}, if $S-\alpha$ has two components, otherwise it is called \textbf{non-separating}.
    \item It is called \textbf{essential} if no component of $S- \alpha$ is a disk.
    \item It is \textbf{non-peripheral} if no component of $S - \alpha$ is an annulus. 
\end{itemize}

We are interested in \textbf{essential} and \textbf{non-peripherial} curves, and all curves will be assumed in this sense unless otherwise specified.

The idea behind the construction of the curve graph is to stratify the set of homotopy classes of curves on a surface. For this to make sense we define the \textbf{geometric intersection number} between free homotopy classes $a$ and $b$ of simple closed curves in a surface $S$. This is defined to be the minimal number of intersection points between a representative curve in the class $a$ and a representative curve in the class $b$:
$$i(a,b) = min \{ |\alpha \cap \beta| : \alpha \in a, \beta \in b \}.$$
It is convenient to adopt a slight abuse of notation by writing $i(\alpha, \beta)$ for the intersection number between the homotopy classes of simple closed curves $\alpha$ and $\beta$. It is useful to think that this number can be computed by finding representatives $\alpha$ and $\beta$ that achieve the minimal intersection in their homotopy classes so that $i(a, b) = |\alpha \cap \beta|$ (when this is the case, we say that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are in minimal position). Although the geometric intersection number is a useful and intuitive invariant it is not always easy to compute, whenever this is the case we can appeal to the algebraic intersection number. For further discussion on this see \cite[Farb]{Farb}.

\subsection{The curve graph}

\begin{defini}
The \textbf{curve graph} $\Gamma(S)$ of a surface $S$ is constructed with the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Vertices}. There is a vertex in $\Gamma(S)$ for every isotopy class of essential, non-peripheral, simple, closed curves in $S$.
\item \textbf{Edges}. There is an edge between the corresponding vertices of isotopy classes $a$ and $b$ whenever $i(a,b)=0$.
\end{itemize}
\end{defini}

\begin{defini}
The \textbf{curve complex of the surface} $C(S)$ is defined to be the flag complex of the curve graph just defined.
\end{defini}

\section{Properties of the curve graph}
The goal of this section is to state known properties of the curve graph, we use this to establish the appropriate parameters in a probabilistic model. Notice that the construction of the curve complex is completely determined by the curve graph, hence the probabilistic models can work in the same sense. Let's keep in mind the following exceptional cases; they are responsible for the conditions stated in the hypothesis of the following theorems for $g$ and $n$. For $ S^2, S_{0,1}, S _{0,2}, S_{0,3} $ the curve graph is empty and for  $ T^{2} $, $ S_{1,1}$ and $ S_{0,4}$ is a countable disjoint union of points.

\subsection{Cardinality of the number of vertices}
\begin{theorem}
If $g\geq 1$ or $n\geq 4$ then the set of vertices in $\Gamma(S_{g,n})$ is countably infinite.
\end{theorem}

It is well known that for $T^{2}$ there is an explicit identification for the isotopy classes of essential curves with the rational numbers. In this case, there aren't disjoint curves, the following figure can help to convince us of this fact.
\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=1]{Figures/Torus.png}
	\caption{$T^{2}$ with representatives of typical elements of curves.}
\end{figure}

This identification can be thought of as the induction basis. The induction step over $g$ comes from splitting the surface, by induction hypotheses none of the resulting surfaces can have a infinitely many classes of curves. Since the surfaces are second countable, the number of classes of curves cannot be uncountable.

\subsection{Connectivity}
\begin{theorem}
If $3g+n\geq 5$, then $\Gamma(S_{g,n})$ is connected.
\end{theorem}

To proof this theorem we can show that, for any two isotopy classes $a$ and $b$ of simple closed curves in $S_{g,n}$ there exists a sequence of isotopy classes
$$a=c_{1},\dots,c_{k}=b,$$
where $i(c_{i},c_{i+1})=0$. This can be done proceeding by induction over $i(a,b)$. The full proof of this theorem can be found in \cite[Farb, p.~93]{Farb}.

\subsection{Locally infinite}
\begin{theorem}
If $3g+n\geq 5$, then $\Gamma(S_{g,n})$ is locally infinite.
\end{theorem}
The idea behind the proof is that given any $\alpha \in \Gamma(S)$ we can construct a family of isotopy classes of curves that are disjoint to $\alpha$. The following picture gives us an intuitive idea on how to do this whenever we have large enough genus.
\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Figures/Locally-infinite.png}
	\caption{$S_{3}$ with typical representative curves which exemplify the idea behind locally infinity property.}
\end{figure}

For the complete argument, let $\alpha$ be any simple closed curve on $S$, the surface $S-\alpha$, obtained by cutting $S$ open along $\alpha$, contains at least one connected component of Euler characteristic at most $-2$ (guaranteed by the $3g+n\geq 5$ condition). Such component contains infinitely many distinct homotopy classes of simple closed curves disjoint from $\alpha$.

\subsection{Clique number}
A \textbf{clique} in a graph $G$ is a complete subgraph of $G$. The clique number $cl(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the maximum order of a clique of $G$.

\begin{theorem}
If $3g+n\geq 5$, then the clique number of $\Gamma(S_{g,n})$ is $3g - 3 + n$.
\end{theorem}

$3g-3+n$ is the number of curves in a pants decomposition of $S$, i.e. a maximal collection of disjoint, not freely homotopic, essential, simple closed curves, which decompose $S$ into $2g-2+n$ open subsurfaces homeomorphic to a thrice punctures sphere. For a full proof of this well-known fact refer to \cite[Hatcher, Thurston 80]{Pants}.

\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Figures/Pantalones.png}
	\caption{Exemplification of a pants decomposition of a surface.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Infinite Diameter}
\begin{theorem}
If $3g+n\geq 5$ then $diam(\Gamma(S)) = \infty$.
\end{theorem}

The proof for this theorem relies on the fact that for any pseudo-Anosov element $h \in Mod(S)$, any $\gamma \in V(\Gamma(S))$ and any $k\in \Z$
$$d_{C}\Big(h^{k}(\gamma), \gamma\Big) \geq c|k|,$$
This provides the infinite diameter property. The proof of this theorem is highly non-trivial, refer to \cite[Masur, Minsky 99]{Masur} for a complete review.

The curve graph and the curve complex are fundamental tools in the study of the surfaces. There several known properties of them that it would be nice to have in mind to improve probabilistic models for further work.

\begin{enumerate}
\item $C(S)$ is hyperbolic.
\item In the infinite genus case $diam(\Gamma(S))= 2$.
\item There's an isomorphism between $Mod^{\ast}(S)$ and $Aut(C(S))$, except when $(g,m) \in \{(1,2), (1,1), (2,0), (0,4)\}$.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Rigidity in graphs}

This section intends to track down the motivation of rigid expansions and give the required definitions.

As mentioned in the introduction of the chapter, rigidity appears in the mapping class group context in light of its comparison with arithmetic groups. In \cite[Aramayona, Souto 16]{rigidityJA} we can find a survey on the search of an analog for the Margulis Superrigidity theorem. In this article, they provide three different perspectives: a Lie theoretical, a geometric, and a folkloric one.

The Lie theoretic version states that every homomorphism $Mod(X) \to Mod(Y)$ is induced by a homomorphism between the associated groups of diffeomorphisms with compact support disjoint from the boundary $\textit{Diff}_{c}(X) \to \textit{Diff}_{c}(Y)$.

A direct formulation of geometric superrigidity cannot hold when the moduli space is endowed with any reasonable metric. However, there are ways to turn this around, saying that every (irreducible) homomorphism between mapping class groups induces a holomorphic map between the corresponding moduli spaces.

The folkloric version of Mostow and Margulis superrigidity claims that the only homomorphisms between lattices are the \textit{“obvious ones”}, in the $Mod(S)$ context this will mean that if we consider $X$ and $Y$, under suitable conditions, then every homomorphism $Mod(X) \to Mod(Y)$ will be induced by manipulation of the underlying surfaces. 

A result due to Ivanov \cite[Ivanov 97]{celebratedIvanov}, Korkmaz \cite[Korkmaz 99]{celebratedKorkmaz} and Luo \cite[Luo 00]{celebratedLuo}, asserts that, excluding few well-understood cases, the curve complexes are simplicially rigid. This means that the group $Aut(C(S))$ of simplicial automorphisms of $C(S)$ is isomorphic to the extended mapping class group. This result is sometimes interpreted as a proof that \textbf{the automorphisms of the curve complex are all geometric}.

In the aim to generalize this result to broader types of simplicial self-maps, in \cite[Aramayona, Leininger 12]{finiteRigidSetsJA} was introduced the concept of \textbf{rigid sets} in the curve complex. Let $S$ be a surface different from $S_{1,2}$,  $Y \subset C(S)$ is called \textbf{rigid} if for every locally injective simplicial map $\Phi  : Y \to C(S)$ there exists $h \in Mod^{\ast}(S)$ with $h|_{Y} = \Phi$, unique up to the pointwise stabilizer of $Y$ in $Mod^{\ast}(S)$.

Later in \cite[Aramayona, Leininger 16]{exhaustingCurveComplex} a method for enlarging rigid subgraphs is presented and the proof that for almost all surfaces of finite topological type, there exists an \textbf{increasing sequence of finite rigid sets} that exhaust the curve graph of which has trivial pointwise stabilizer in $Mod^{\ast}(S_{g,n})$.

In \cite[Hernández 19]{exhaustionCurveGraph} there is a proof of a similar result to Aramayona and Leininger's. The method,  called \textbf{rigid expansions}, allowed to obtain new results concerning edge-preserving maps. 

Losing the big picture that rigidity represents, we can land this vast journey in the following graph-theoretic definitions.

\begin{defini}
Let $\Gamma$ be a simplicial graph and $H<\Gamma$ a vertex-induced subgraph. A function $f:H\to \Gamma$ is \textbf{locally injective} if $f|_{star(v)}$ is injective for all $v \in V(H)$. 
\end{defini}

\begin{nota}
Remember, $star(v)$ is the vertex-induced subgraph with vertices $\{ v \} \cup N(v)$ ($v$ plus its neighborhood).
\end{nota}

\begin{defini}
$H<\Gamma$ is \textbf{rigid} if every locally injective function defined in $H$ can be extended to an automorphism of $\Gamma$. \end{defini}

A vertex $v \in V$ in a graph is uniquely determined by $A\subset V(G)$, denoted $v=\langle A \rangle$, if $v$ is the unique common neighbor of every element of $B$, i.e.
$$ \{ v \} = \bigcap_{w\in B} lnk(w).$$
\begin{defini}
The first rigid expansion of $Y\subset \Gamma$, denoted by $Y^{1}$, is the vertex-induced subgraph whose vertices are
$$ V(Y) \cup \{ v\in V(\Gamma) :  \exists A \subset V(Y) \text{ where } v = \langle A \rangle  \}.$$
We also define $Y^{0} = Y$ and, inductively, $Y^{k} = (Y^{k-1})^{1}$.
\end{defini}

Recalling that in Proposition 3.5 in \cite[Aramayona, Leininger 16]{finiteRigidSetsJA}, Aramayona and Leininger prove that if $Y \subset C(S)$ is a rigid set, then so is $Y^{r} $ for all $r \geq 0$. So this method in fact preserves the desired property.

It would be nice to have conditions which determine whether a subgraph is rigid or not. So far we don't know non-trivial, necessary conditions to check rigidity, i.e. other than connectivity there's not much else.

With these definitions, we can proceed to settle a probabilistic model so that we can analyze the rigidity concept in graphs from a stochastic point of view. With the reviewed properties of the curve graph, we can determine the feasibility of studying the curve graph through simple models.
